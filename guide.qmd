## What today is ...

- We'll introduce you to R & RStudio. It will go fast, but there are notes
- We'll use a cloud version so you don't have to install software
- Our "project" is both the lesson and the workspace
- Most code is pre-written so you can focus on the concepts
- You will have time to experiment

## ... and what today isn't

Three hours just isn't much time.
 
- This is just an introduction.
- Hopefully this demystifies R a little and makes you curious
- Take my class!

There are many resources online. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) is the tidyverse bible. It's free.

## Thank you for coming
