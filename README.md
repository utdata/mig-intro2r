# Intro to R for Storytelling

A workshop to introduce data science programming skills to Moody College students.

## Notes

In addition to files for students, this repo includes some resource code to gather data and present the workshop.

- There is a `render` list in `_quarto.yml` to restrict the rendering process to the student files. This means other files might need to be manually rendered.

## To do

- look at resources/joins-mutate.qmd. I need to build data for viz, but could also maybe use within the workshop?
    - but I really should just ove this to data-prep.qmd.
- Visualizations is not finished.
- For tidyverse, I changed `n` to `times_given`. I'm kinda regretting that.
