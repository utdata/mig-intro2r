# Intro to R for Storytelling

A workshop to introduce data science programming skills to Moody College students.

## Notes

In addition to files for students, this repo includes some resource code to gather data and present the workshop.

- The thought is to use posit.cloud for the workshop and have students work directly from the three Quarto files.
- There is a `render` list in `_quarto.yml` to restrict the rendering process to the student files. This means other files might need to be manually rendered.
