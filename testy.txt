title: "Introduction to R for Storytelling"
---

Welcome to this three-hour workshop where you'll be introduced to the basics of the data science language R and some tools to use it to find and tell stories.

In this workshop we'll explore the popularity of names in the United States over time. We'll use data from the Social Security Administration, which has been tracking the popularity of baby names since 1880.

## Using posit.cloud

This workshop is designed to be run in the cloud, so you don't need to install any software on your computer. We'll be using a tool called [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/), which is an online version of R & RStudio, the popular data analysis tools.

1. Go to [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/), which is an online version of R & RStudio, the tools we'll use in this workshop.
2. If you don't already have an account, use the **Sign up** or **Get Started** options to create a new account. If you already have an account, go ahead and log in.
3. Once you are logged into posit.cloud, go to this URL: **[posit.cloud/content/9098983](https://posit.cloud/content/9098983)**
4. We'll start with the file 01-introduction.qmd

::: callout
While this lesson is designed to be run on posit.cloud in a workshop situation, but there is no reason it can't be completed using [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) if you are familiar with it. The lessons would need to be [downloaded from Github](https://github.com/utdata/mig-intro2r) and packages installed, but directions for that are beyond the scope of this lesson.
